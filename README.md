# Rust React Template

This project is a work in progress web application template using low-level open source software.

It is designed to be secure, cloud native, very low CPU and memory footprint and handle hundreds of users in parallel even from a 30$ VPS.

It is currently in a very early stage.

When finished, its goal is for a developer or company to be able to clone the project, implement only their frontend and backend using React Router and Axum, follow a short tutorial on how to deploy and then have an application able to handle a huge load for the fraction of the cost required when using a cloud platform.
